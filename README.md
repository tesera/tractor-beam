Tractor Beam is an android app whcih will beam up a single page website into a hybrid environment. The first time you open the Tractor Beam application you will need to initialize it with a URL to a single-page web app i.e. web address to index.html. The application will then load the index page as well as all its referenced resources and store them locally. As soon as you have added the URL and clicked on fetch the web app will appear as a full screen app. The next time the app is started it will show the web app.

* clearing: Need a method to start from fresh. Delete application data from setting? 
* updates: Need a method to trigger updates either manually or automatically via http headers when online.
* external resources: Need a method to map url's to a ContentProvider Authority.
